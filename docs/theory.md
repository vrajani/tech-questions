#Theory

•	Generics
•	multi-threading (started)
•	java compiler
•	SQL vs NOSQL
    o	Why use nosql for high performing database – Availability
    o	ACID vs CAP – integrity , scalability
•	DONE: Key Things to Build REST API.
•	Put vs POST (idempotent)
•	REST vs SOAP
•	What is a Design Pattern in 2-3 sentences?
•	What is difference between a library and framework
•	Messaging Queue use cases:
    o	driven by events.
    o	Priority based to a message.
    o	Security.
    o	Data integrity.
    o	Recovery support.
•	Advantages of Typed languages vs loosely typed language
    o	It takes advantage of compiler type checking. This catches statements that can fail at run time due to errors such as overflow. It also catches calls to methods on objects that do not support them.
    o	It results in faster execution of your code.
    o	Easier to Read or in other words it is more human readable
•	Microservice Key Features:
    o	Independent Development – All microservices can be easily developed based on their individual functionality
    o	Independent Deployment – Based on their services, they can be individually deployed in any application
    o	Fault Isolation – Even if one service of the application does not work, the system still continues to function
    o	Mixed Technology Stack – Different languages and technologies can be used to build different services of the same application
    o	Granular Scaling
•	DONE: StringBuffer vs StringBuilder
•	Garbage Collection – how it knows to destroy an object?
