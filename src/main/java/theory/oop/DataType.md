# What is data type? Advantage and disadvantage.

Strong Typing
* Specifying data types for all your variables is known as strong typing. Using strong typing has several advantages:



#### Advantages

* It enables IntelliSense support for your variables. This allows you to see their properties and other members as you type in the code.
* It takes advantage of compiler type checking. This catches statements that can fail at run time due to errors such as overflow. It also catches calls to methods on objects that do not support them.
* It results in faster execution of your code.
* Easier to Read or in other words it is more human readable

#### Disadvantages

* Typeless languages are very flexible and dynamic, resulting in quick turn around of code.
