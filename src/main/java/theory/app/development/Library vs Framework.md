# Library vs Framework

### Library
Library is a collection of precompiled snippets of code that can be used by multiple application/service independently.

The library helps avoid duplication of code and provide uniform way of performing certain process for different sources that uses them.

### Framework

A software framework, is an abstraction in which common code providing generic functionality can be selectively overridden or specialized by user code providing specific functionality.

Framework gels into the application code and provides the backbone to the application.

### Difference

##### Inversion Of Control
With Library, the application that uses the library calls in the functions implemented in library.

Where as, when it comes to a framework, the framework is in control and makes the calls to the application code. The framework provides the inbuilt control of flow. There are certain blank pieces in the framework that is filled in through application code that uses it.
